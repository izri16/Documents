  not polyfills. Need 'presets' which defines sets of transforms
  that babel-core applies to files. Presets can be stored in .babelrc.

  Better install localy.

    babel

    babel-node
      Can run scripts from command line or be used as REPL.
      Automatically requires babel-polyfill and babel-register.
      Not for production use.

babel-register

  Similar thinks can do babel-runtime.
  Not for production use.

babel-polyfill

  Add polyfill for promises, Array etc.

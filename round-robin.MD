# Round robin

Just a scheduling algorithm which decides fixed "time slot" and then assign it to each "task/process" in order. If the task does not finish within that "time slot" it is
stoped and the next task is assigned for that exact "time slot" and so on. It the task terminates the next task is scheduled immediately.

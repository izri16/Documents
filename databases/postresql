# Postgresql

## Scaling options
Generaly relational database are easy to scale vertically (add more CPU/RAM/Storage), but harder to scale horizontaly (multiple instances).
For example Amazon RDS allows vertical scaling up to 64TB for postresql database with option to set read replicas.
For storing even more data one would probably need to use NoSQL database that is easier to scale horizontally.

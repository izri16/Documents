# Serverless

## Pros
* Pricing
* Reduced maintenance
* Auto scaling
* Faster delivery of simpler app

## Cons
* Vendor specific env (can not easily transfer from Google to Amazon)
* Performance (latency issues if server is down due to being idle etc)
* Logging migh be issue, if there is not good service for that
* Might have week support for continues integation and multiple environments compared
  to using Dockerized approach
